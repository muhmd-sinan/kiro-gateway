## 🤖 Available Models (Free List)

> ⚠️ **Important:** Model availability depends on your Kiro tier (free/paid). The gateway provides access to whatever models are available in your IDE or CLI based on your subscription. The list below shows models commonly available on the **free tier**.

> 🔒 **Claude Opus 4.5** was removed from the free tier on January 17, 2026. It may be available on paid tiers — check your IDE/CLI model list.

🚀 **Claude Sonnet 4.5** — Balanced performance. Great for coding, writing, and general-purpose tasks.

⚡ **Claude Haiku 4.5** — Lightning fast. Perfect for quick responses, simple tasks, and chat.

📦 **Claude Sonnet 4** — Previous generation. Still powerful and reliable for most use cases.

💤 **GLM-5** — Open MoE model (744B params, 40B active). Advanced model for complex systems engineering and long-horizon agentic tasks.

🐋 **DeepSeek-V3.2** — Open MoE model (685B params, 37B active). Balanced performance for coding, reasoning, and general tasks.

🧩 **MiniMax M2.5** — Open MoE model (230B params, 10B active). Enhanced version with improved reasoning and task handling.

🧩 **MiniMax M2.1** — Open MoE model (230B params, 10B active). Great for complex tasks, planning, and multi-step workflows.

🤖 **Qwen3-Coder-Next** — Open MoE model (80B params, 3B active). Coding-focused. Excellent for development and large projects.

> 💡 **Smart Model Resolution:** Use any model name format — `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4.5`, or even versioned names like `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`. The gateway normalizes them automatically.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Choose your deployment method:**
- 🐍 **Native Python** - Full control, easy debugging
- 🐳 **Docker** - Isolated environment, easy deployment → [jump to Docker](#-docker-deployment)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- One of the following:
  - [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/) with logged in account, OR
  - [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/cli/) with AWS SSO (AWS IAM Identity Center, OIDC) - free Builder ID or corporate account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (requires Git)
git clone https://github.com/Jwadow/kiro-gateway.git
cd kiro-gateway

# Or download ZIP: Code → Download ZIP → extract → open kiro-gateway folder

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure (see Configuration section)
cp .env.example .env
# Copy and edit .env with your credentials

# Start the server
python main.py

# Or with custom port (if 8787 is busy)
python main.py --port 9000
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

> 💡 **Advanced users:** Looking for multi-account support? See [Account System](#-account-system-advanced) below.

### Option 1: JSON Credentials File (Kiro IDE / Enterprise)

Specify the path to the credentials file:

Works with:
- **Kiro IDE** (standard) - for personal accounts
- **Enterprise** - for corporate accounts with SSO

```env
KIRO_CREDS_FILE="~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json"

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server (make up any secure string)
# You'll use this as api_key when connecting to your gateway
PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"
```

<details>
<summary>📄 JSON file format</summary>

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJ...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJ...",
  "expiresAt": "2025-01-12T23:00:00.000Z",
  "profileArn": "arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:...",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "clientIdHash": "abc123..."  // Optional: for corporate SSO setups
}
```

> **Note:** If you have two JSON files in `~/.aws/sso/cache/` (e.g., `kiro-auth-token.json` and a file with a hash name), use `kiro-auth-token.json` in `KIRO_CREDS_FILE`. The gateway will automatically load the other file.

</details>

### Option 2: Environment Variables (.env file)

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required
REFRESH_TOKEN="your_kiro_refresh_token"

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server (make up any secure string)
PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"

# Optional
PROFILE_ARN="arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:..."
KIRO_REGION="us-east-1"
```

### Option 3: AWS SSO Credentials (kiro-cli / Enterprise)

If you use `kiro-cli` or Kiro IDE with AWS SSO (AWS IAM Identity Center), the gateway will automatically detect and use the appropriate authentication.

Works with both free Builder ID accounts and corporate accounts.

```env
KIRO_CREDS_FILE="~/.aws/sso/cache/your-sso-cache-file.json"

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server
PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"

# Note: PROFILE_ARN is NOT needed for AWS SSO (Builder ID and corporate accounts)
# The gateway will work without it
```

<details>
<summary>📄 AWS SSO JSON file format</summary>

AWS SSO credentials files (from `~/.aws/sso/cache/`) contain:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJ...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJ...",
  "expiresAt": "2025-01-12T23:00:00.000Z",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "clientId": "...",
  "clientSecret": "..."
}
```

**Note:** AWS SSO (Builder ID and corporate accounts) users do NOT need `profileArn`. The gateway will work without it (if specified, it will be ignored).

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔍 How it works</summary>

The gateway automatically detects the authentication type based on the credentials file:

- **Kiro Desktop Auth** (default): Used when `clientId` and `clientSecret` are NOT present
  - Endpoint: `https://prod.{region}.auth.desktop.kiro.dev/refreshToken`
  
- **AWS SSO (OIDC)**: Used when `clientId` and `clientSecret` ARE present
  - Endpoint: `https://oidc.{region}.amazonaws.com/token`

No additional configuration is needed — just point to your credentials file!

</details>

### Option 4: kiro-cli SQLite Database

If you use `kiro-cli` and prefer to use its SQLite database directly:

```env
KIRO_CLI_DB_FILE="~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3"

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server
PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"

# Note: PROFILE_ARN is NOT needed for AWS SSO (Builder ID and corporate accounts)
# The gateway will work without it
```

<details>
<summary>📄 Database locations</summary>

| CLI Tool | Database Path |
|----------|---------------|
| kiro-cli | `~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3` |
| amazon-q-developer-cli | `~/.local/share/amazon-q/data.sqlite3` |

The gateway reads credentials from the `auth_kv` table which stores:
- `kirocli:odic:token` or `codewhisperer:odic:token` — access token, refresh token, expiration
- `kirocli:odic:device-registration` or `codewhisperer:odic:device-registration` — client ID and secret

Both key formats are supported for compatibility with different kiro-cli versions.

</details>

### Getting Credentials

**For Kiro IDE users:**
- Log in to Kiro IDE and use Option 1 above (JSON credentials file)
- The credentials file is created automatically after login

**For Kiro CLI users:**
- Log in with `kiro-cli login` and use Option 3 or Option 4 above
- No manual token extraction needed!

<details>
<summary>🔧 Advanced: Manual token extraction</summary>

If you need to manually extract the refresh token (e.g., for debugging), you can intercept Kiro IDE traffic:
- Look for requests to: `prod.us-east-1.auth.desktop.kiro.dev/refreshToken`

</details>

---

## 🔀 Account System (Advanced)

Account System is a way to manage multiple Kiro accounts with automatic failover. In the future, this system will replace `.env` file for credential configuration, but currently it's optional and intended for those who want to use multiple accounts.

### Why You Need This

If you have multiple Kiro accounts, the gateway can automatically switch between them when account is temporarily unavailable.

The system works with a single account too — just without switching.

### How to Enable

Add to your `.env`:

```env
ACCOUNT_SYSTEM=true
```

**What happens:**
- On first startup, your credentials from `.env` are automatically migrated to `credentials.json` (one-time)
- After that, all account and region settings from `.env` are ignored
- Account management only through `credentials.json`

<details>
<summary>📄 Configuration Examples</summary>

**Single account:**
```json
[
  {
    "type": "json",
    "path": "~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json"
  }
]
```

**Multiple accounts:**
```json
[
  {
    "type": "json",
    "path": "~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json"
  },
  {
    "type": "sqlite",
    "path": "~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3"
  },
  {
    "type": "refresh_token",
    "refresh_token": "eyJhbGc...",
    "profile_arn": "arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:..."
  }
]
```

**Folder with files:**
```json
[
  {
    "type": "json",
    "path": "C:\\MyAccs\\kiro67"
  }
]
```

The gateway will scan all files in the folder and add them as separate accounts.

</details>

### How Failover Works

When one account returns an error (429 rate limit, 402 quota exceeded), the gateway automatically tries the next account from the list. If an account fails several times in a row, the gateway temporarily stops using it and periodically checks if it has recovered.

For a single account, failover doesn't work — you get the original error from Kiro API.

For complete configuration examples (including per-account region settings), see [`credentials.json.example`](credentials.json.example).

## 🖥️ Claude Desktop (Third-Party Inference)

Recent Claude Desktop builds ship a **Configure third-party inference** panel
(under `Developer` -> `Model configuration`) where you can point the app at a
custom inference gateway. Kiro Gateway works out of the box:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Gateway base URL | `http://localhost:8787` (or your `SERVER_HOST` / `SERVER_PORT`) |
| Gateway API key | Your `PROXY_API_KEY` from `.env` |
| Gateway auth scheme | `x-api-key` (or `Authorization: Bearer` - both work) |
| Credential kind | `Static API key` |

Hit **Test connection** - you should see two green checks (`Model discovery`
and `Inference`). The gateway advertises models in a hybrid envelope that
includes Anthropic's `type`, `display_name`, `created_at`, and `has_more`
fields alongside the OpenAI-shaped payload, so the model dropdown populates
automatically.

Long-running requests (extended thinking, big tool loops) are kept alive with
`event: ping` SSE keepalives every ~15 seconds, matching Anthropic's own
streaming behavior - Claude Desktop won't disconnect mid-generation.

### Getting all models to appear in the picker (dash-form aliases)

Claude Desktop's in-chat model picker whitelists Anthropic-canonical dash-form
ids (`claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`). The gateway automatically emits
those aliases alongside the Kiro-native dot form (`claude-opus-4.8`,
`claude-sonnet-4.6`) so all Claude-family entries light up as selectable
instead of being marked *Unavailable*. No configuration needed - both forms
route to the same Kiro model.

### Enabling 1M-context on individual models

Kiro serves Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, Opus 4.7, Opus 4.8, and Sonnet 5 with a **1
million-token** context window. Claude Desktop, however, treats the 1M window
as an opt-in feature per model - the default in its UI is 200k. To turn it on:

1. Open the **Configure third-party inference** panel.
2. Scroll past the base URL / API key section to **Models**.
3. Click **+ Add model** and enter the dash-form id (for example
   `claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, or `claude-sonnet-5`).
4. Enable the **1M context** toggle next to that model.
5. Save. The model will now use the full 1M window on subsequent requests.

The gateway already advertises the correct `contextWindowTokens` per model on
`GET /v1/models`, so the toggle merely tells Claude Desktop to trust that
larger window when composing requests.

### Using GPT-5.6 in Claude Desktop (disguise aliases)

Kiro also exposes OpenAI's preview trio `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and
`gpt-5.6-luna`, but Claude Desktop's model picker hard-filters ids to Claude
family names and marks anything with a dot in the version segment as
*Unavailable*. To keep them reachable, the gateway advertises each under a
Claude-shaped alias so the picker whitelists them:

| Kiro model | Claude Desktop id (dot form) | Companion (dash form) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | `claude-sol-5.6` | `claude-sol-5-6` |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | `claude-terra-5.6` | `claude-terra-5-6` |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | `claude-luna-5.6` | `claude-luna-5-6` |

Both forms route to the same underlying Kiro model - the dash companion is a
safety net in case a Claude Desktop build enforces the "no dots" rule strictly.
Add either id in the **Configure third-party inference** panel, or pick from
the model dropdown.

The context window for these models is **272k tokens** regardless of Claude
Desktop's 1M-context toggle. Leave the toggle off for these chats - if a
request overflows the 272k ceiling, Kiro will reject it and the gateway will
surface the error verbatim.

The mapping lives in `MODEL_ALIASES` inside [`kiro/config.py`](kiro/config.py).
Add, rename, or remove entries there and restart the gateway to reshape the
list.

Windows users can grab convenience scripts under [`windows/`](windows/README.md):
one-click `Claude with Kiro.cmd` starts the gateway (if needed) and launches
Claude Desktop in a single action.

## 🌐 VPN/Proxy Support

**For users in China, corporate networks, or regions with connectivity issues to AWS services.**

The gateway supports routing all Kiro API requests through a VPN or proxy server. This is essential if you experience connection problems to AWS endpoints or need to use a corporate proxy.

### Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# HTTP proxy
VPN_PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7890

# SOCKS5 proxy
VPN_PROXY_URL=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080

# With authentication (corporate proxies)
VPN_PROXY_URL=http://username:password@proxy.company.com:8080

# Without protocol (defaults to http://)
VPN_PROXY_URL=192.168.1.100:8080
```

### Supported Protocols

- ✅ **HTTP** — Standard proxy protocol
- ✅ **HTTPS** — Secure proxy connections
- ✅ **SOCKS5** — Advanced proxy protocol (common in VPN software)
- ✅ **Authentication** — Username/password embedded in URL

### When You Need This

| Situation | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Connection timeouts to AWS | Use VPN/proxy to route traffic |
| Corporate network restrictions | Configure your company's proxy |
| Regional connectivity issues | Use a VPN service with proxy support |
| Privacy requirements | Route through your own proxy server |

### Popular VPN Software with Proxy Support

Most VPN clients provide a local proxy server you can use:
- **Sing-box** — Modern VPN client with HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy
- **Clash** — Usually runs on `http://127.0.0.1:7890`
- **V2Ray** — Configurable SOCKS5/HTTP proxy
- **Shadowsocks** — SOCKS5 proxy support
- **Corporate VPN** — Check your IT department for proxy settings

Leave `VPN_PROXY_URL` empty (default) if you don't need proxy support.

## 🔧 Debugging

Debug logging is **disabled by default**. To enable, add to your `.env`:

```env
# Debug logging mode:
# - off: disabled (default)
# - errors: save logs only for failed requests (4xx, 5xx) - recommended for troubleshooting
# - all: save logs for every request (overwrites on each request)
DEBUG_MODE=errors
```

### Debug Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `off` | Disabled (default) | Production |
| `errors` | Save logs only for failed requests (4xx, 5xx) | **Recommended for troubleshooting** |
| `all` | Save logs for every request | Development/debugging |

### Debug Files

When enabled, requests are logged to the `debug_logs/` folder:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `request_body.json` | Incoming request from client (OpenAI format) |
| `kiro_request_body.json` | Request sent to Kiro API |
| `response_stream_raw.txt` | Raw stream from Kiro |
| `response_stream_modified.txt` | Transformed stream (OpenAI format) |
| `app_logs.txt` | Application logs for the request |
| `error_info.json` | Error details (only on errors) |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Error: "Name or service not known" or DNS resolution failed**

The Q API endpoint may not be publicly resolvable in your region. Use a VPN or proxy:

```env
VPN_PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7890
```

See [VPN/Proxy Support](#-vpnproxy-support) for details.

---

**Error: "503 Service Unavailable" through proxy**

The Q API endpoint exists in specific regions only. Try a different region:

```env
KIRO_API_REGION="eu-central-1"  # or us-east-1
```

Commonly reachable regions: `us-east-1`, `eu-central-1`

---

**OIDC works but Q API fails**

Your SSO region may differ from the Q API region. The gateway auto-detects this from credentials, but you can override:

```env
KIRO_API_REGION="eu-central-1"
```

## 🧪 Fork notes

This fork adds a handful of improvements on top of upstream v2.3:

- **Claude Desktop third-party inference** - extended the `/v1/models` envelope
  with Anthropic-shape fields (`type`, `display_name`, `created_at`,
  `has_more`) so Claude Desktop's model dropdown populates. Same endpoint
  still serves OpenAI clients.
- **Anthropic `GET /v1/models/{id}`** - added the missing retrieve route.
- **SSE `event: ping` keepalives** - Anthropic streams now emit `ping` events
  every ~15s of upstream silence, preventing Claude Desktop / proxies from
  killing long thinking or tool loops.
- **`input_tokens` in `message_delta.usage`** - matches the current Anthropic
  streaming spec.
- **Refreshed model catalog** - synced with `kiro-cli chat --list-models`
  (Kiro CLI 2.11.1): added Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Opus 4.8, and the
  GPT-5.6 (`sol`/`terra`/`luna`) previews. Dropped imaginary `-1m` variants -
  Kiro exposes 1M-context on the base id directly.
- **Dash-form Claude aliases** - `/v1/models` emits both `claude-opus-4.8`
  (Kiro-native) and `claude-opus-4-8` (Anthropic-canonical), so all
  Claude-family models light up in Claude Desktop's picker.
- **`role: "system"` folding** - Claude Desktop sends `system` in the
  messages array; the gateway folds it into the top-level `system` field
  and lets Pydantic keep the schema clean.
- **Correct `contextWindowTokens` per model** - `/v1/models` now advertises
  the real 1M context for Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.6+ / Sonnet 5.
- **Constant-time API key comparison** on both routers.
- **Loopback-by-default bind** - `SERVER_HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1`; set
  `0.0.0.0` explicitly for LAN / Docker exposure.
- **Windows helper scripts** under [`windows/`](windows/README.md): start /
  stop / status / ping, a Claude Desktop launcher, Task Scheduler auto-start,
  and a shortcut generator.
- **Default port `8787`** - gateway-wide default (less contested than `8000`),
  matching the `windows/` helper scripts.
